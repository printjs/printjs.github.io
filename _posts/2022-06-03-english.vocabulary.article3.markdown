# 4 killed, 41 injured after earthquake hits China's Sichuan

Four people were killed, 41 others were injured and one of the injured was in **critical**`(adj|批评性的，文艺评论的，危机的，严重的)` condition as of 9:00 am on Thursday after two earthquakes struck Ya'an, Sichuan province.

According to the general office of the Ya'an municipal committee of the **Communist**`(n|共产主义者)` Party of China, the four people perished after being hit by falling stones.

Located in the western part of Sichuan, Ya'an has many mountains.

An earthquake of 6.1 magnitude hit Lushan, a county under the administration of Ya'an, at 5 pm on Wednesday according to the China Earthquake Networks Center.

Three minutes later, a magnitude-4.5 earthquake was **observed**`(v|观察，关注)` in Baoxing, another county under the administration of Ya'an, at 5:03 pm.

According to the Sichuan Earthquake Administration, the Lushan earthquake on Wednesday was an aftershock of the Lushan earthquake that killed 196 people and injured 12,614 on April 20, 2013.

It is unlikely that a larger aftershock will occur in the near future, it said.

The **epicenter**`(n|震中)` of the 2013 quake is in Longmen **township**`(n|镇区)`, 9 km away from Wednesday's earthquake.

Two aftershocks at and above magnitude-3.0 were recorded as of 8 o'clock on June 2, according to the center.
